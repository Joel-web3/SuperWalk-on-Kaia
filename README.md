### **What is SuperWalk?**

SuperWalk is a **Move-to-Earn** platform that rewards users with blockchain tokens for engaging in physical activity. By walking or running, users earn $WALK and $GRND tokens, which can be used for a variety of in-app purposes, including purchasing items, leveling up NFTs, and participating in community-driven governance.

The SuperWalk platform combines the benefits of fitness with the power of blockchain rewards, ensuring that every step users take contributes to a healthier lifestyle while engaging with a decentralized community. The introduction of **NFT shoes** and the **$GRND governance token** adds a game-like element to the platform, offering an incentive for users to not only stay active but also engage with the ecosystem and participate in governance decisions.

### **SuperWalk’s Role in Kaia’s Social-Fi Revolution**

SuperWalk isn’t just about earning tokens—it's about fostering a **community**. Its integration with Kaia, a blockchain known for its **Social-Fi** features like the **Raffle System** and **peer-to-peer item trading market**, allows SuperWalk to create a seamless blend of **social interaction** and **financial rewards**. Through this ecosystem, users can interact socially, form communities around fitness goals, and govern their own space using $GRND tokens.

This **Social-Fi** approach is redefining how users interact with Web3 applications. Instead of just passive participation, users are now incentivized to engage actively in the platform, with real-world actions (walking/running) converting into in-app rewards that are both **fun** and **financially valuable**.

But how can we measure the **effectiveness** of this Social-Fi revolution? Let’s dive into the data!

#### **4. Whale Activity: Driving Liquidity and Governance**

SuperWalk’s **Total Weekly Transactions** chart reflects high transaction volumes, driven in part by a small segment of highly active users. Weekly transactions have stabilized at over **46.8 million transactions**, contributing to the cumulative total surpassing **45 million.**

<img width="524" alt="s7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5168c0c7-2764-4a0f-873f-66082216ec63">

These users not only boost liquidity within the platform but also contribute significantly to governance activities. By holding large amounts of $GRND tokens, these users have an outsized influence on SuperWalk’s direction and policies. Their activity underscores the importance of incentivizing both small-scale participants and larger investors.

### **5. Total Weekly Users**
This chart demonstrates the weekly user activity and the cumulative user growth on the platform. The **weekly users** (pink bars) experienced a sharp rise mid-2023, aligning with a significant network event or campaign. 

<img width="521" alt="s4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc3fee0f-a13d-4a86-b7f6-69e3d2478ddc">

However, after this peak, there has been a gradual decline in weekly users, indicating a potential drop in consistent engagement. Despite the weekly fluctuations, the **cumulative user base** (blue line) continues to rise steadily, surpassing 3.6 million users. This suggests that while new users are joining the network, retaining active participation week-to-week may require strategic interventions.

### **6. Total Weekly Transactions**
The second chart focuses on weekly transaction counts (orange bars) and cumulative transaction volume (purple line). Weekly transactions exhibit a pattern similar to user activity, with a massive spike around mid-2023, which then stabilizes at lower levels. 

<img width="524" alt="s3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41861944-34ba-49c1-b748-ef55d741a69d">

Interestingly, despite the reduced weekly transactions, the **cumulative transactions** show continuous growth, crossing 45 million. This indicates that even with a smaller group of active users, the network sustains a high level of transactional activity, pointing to power users or whales driving the ecosystem.

### **Methodology: How We Analyzed SuperWalk’s Impact on Kaia’s Social-Fi Ecosystem**

To extract actionable insights and understand SuperWalk’s role in driving Kaia’s Social-Fi revolution, we relied on data from **Flipside Analytics**—a powerful tool for blockchain data analysis. Let’s walk through the steps we used to derive these results.


#### **Analyzing User Acquisition and Retention**

We queried the **Kaia core transaction data** to measure both **new users** and **active users** over a defined period. Specifically, we tracked **user first transactions** and **subsequent activity** over 30-day and 90-day intervals. This allowed us to observe trends in **new user sign-ups** and **repeat interactions** on the platform.

**Example Query on New & Returning Users**

```WITH base AS (
  SELECT 
    block_timestamp,
    origin_from_address
  FROM kaia.core.fact_event_logs
   WHERE origin_to_address IN ('0x990d8cfbce8892e2126f85637f3728b53266b45e', 
                              '0x84f8c3c8d6ee30a559d73ec570d574f671e82647', 
                              '0x63d4f17d2a8a729fd050f7679d961b1dfbb1e3af')
    AND block_timestamp >= '2022-06-20'
),
first_activity AS (
  SELECT 
    origin_from_address AS user_address,
    MIN(DATE(block_timestamp)) AS first_seen
  FROM base
  GROUP BY origin_from_address
),
weekly_data AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', base.block_timestamp) AS week,
    base.origin_from_address,
    MIN(DATE(base.block_timestamp)) AS activity_date,
    first_activity.first_seen
  FROM base
  JOIN first_activity
  ON base.origin_from_address = first_activity.user_address
  GROUP BY week, base.origin_from_address, first_activity.first_seen
),
user_type_classification AS (
  SELECT
    week,
    origin_from_address,
    CASE 
      WHEN activity_date = first_seen THEN 'new'
      ELSE 'returning'
    END AS user_type
  FROM weekly_data
)
SELECT
  week,
  user_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT origin_from_address) AS user_count
FROM user_type_classification
GROUP BY week, user_type
ORDER BY week, user_type;
```

The key columns we focused on include:

* `from_address` (the unique identifier for each user)
* `block_timestamp` (which tells us the time of each transaction)
* `tx_hash` (to count the number of unique transactions per user)

We then aggregated this data to track how many users returned after their first interaction and how many new users joined the platform each week.

#### **Analyzing $GRND Staking Activity**

Governance activity surrounding **$GRND tokens** was tracked by analyzing transaction histories where $GRND tokens were used for **staking**, **governance proposals**, and **community actions**. This provided insight into how users are interacting with the decentralized governance features of the platform.

Key columns:

* `token_address`
* `value`
* `from_address`

**Example Query on $GRND Staking Activity**

```WITH base AS (
  SELECT
    tx_hash,
    origin_from_address,
    amount,
    amount_usd,
    block_timestamp
  FROM kaia.core.ez_token_transfers  
  WHERE to_address = '0x9bcb2efc545f89986cf70d3adc39079a1b730d63' -- staked GRND
),
weekly_data AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', block_timestamp) AS week,
    COUNT(DISTINCT origin_from_address) AS weekly_stakers,
    COUNT(tx_hash) AS weekly_staking,
    SUM(amount) AS weekly_grnd_staked
  FROM base
  GROUP BY week
),
daily_data AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(block_timestamp) AS day,
    SUM(amount) AS daily_grnd_staked
  FROM base
  GROUP BY day
),
cumulative_data AS (
  SELECT
    block_timestamp,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY block_timestamp) AS cumulative_grnd_staked
  FROM base
)
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT origin_from_address) FROM base) AS total_grnd_stakers,
  (SELECT COUNT(tx_hash) FROM base) AS total_grnd_staking,
  (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM base) AS total_grnd_staked,
  (SELECT SUM(amount_usd) FROM base) AS total_grnd_staked_in_usd,
  weekly_data.week,
  weekly_data.weekly_stakers,
  weekly_data.weekly_staking,
  weekly_data.weekly_grnd_staked,
  daily_data.day,
  daily_data.daily_grnd_staked,
  cumulative_data.block_timestamp,
  cumulative_data.cumulative_grnd_staked
FROM weekly_data
JOIN daily_data ON weekly_data.week = DATE_TRUNC('week', daily_data.day)
JOIN cumulative_data ON DATE_TRUNC('week', cumulative_data.block_timestamp) = weekly_data.week
ORDER BY cumulative_data.block_timestamp;
```
